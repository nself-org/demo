# Hasura Actions - Custom GraphQL Operations
#
# Define custom queries and mutations here that are handled by your
# Next.js API routes or serverless functions.
#
# Example:
#
# type Mutation {
#   sendWelcomeEmail(userId: uuid!): SendEmailResponse
# }
#
# type SendEmailResponse {
#   success: Boolean!
#   message: String
# }
#
# After defining actions here, configure them in actions.yaml,
# then apply with: hasura metadata apply
